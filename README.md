COSBench - Cloud Object Storage Benchmark
=========================================

COSBench is a benchmarking tool to measure the performance of Cloud Object Storage services. Object storage is an 
emerging technology that is different from traditional file systems (e.g., NFS) or block device systems (e.g., iSCSI).
Amazon S3 and Openstack* swift are well-known object storage solutions.

COSBench now supports OpenStack* Swift and Amplidata v2.3, 2.5 and 3.1, as well as custom adaptors.
